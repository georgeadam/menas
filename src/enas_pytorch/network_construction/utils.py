def _construct_dags(prev_nodes, activations, func_names, num_blocks):
    """Constructs a set of DAGs based on the actions, i.e., previous nodes and
    activation functions, sampled from the controller/policy pi.

    Args:
        prev_nodes: Previous node actions from the policy.
        activations: Activations sampled from the policy.
        func_names: Mapping from activation function names to functions.
        num_blocks: Number of blocks in the target RNN cell.

    Returns:
        A list of DAGs defined by the inputs.

    RNN cell DAGs are represented in the following way:

    1. Each element (node) in a DAG is a list of `Node`s.

    2. The `Node`s in the list dag[i] correspond to the subsequent nodes
       that take the output from node i as their own input.

    3. dag[-1] is the node that takes input from x^{(t)} and h^{(t - 1)}.
       dag[-1] always feeds dag[0].
       dag[-1] acts as if `w_xc`, `w_hc`, `w_xh` and `w_hh` are its
       weights.

    4. dag[N - 1] is the node that produces the hidden state passed to
       the next timestep. dag[N - 1] is also always a leaf node, and therefore
       is always averaged with the other leaf nodes and fed to the output
       decoder.
